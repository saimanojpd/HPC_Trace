# HPC_Trace
This git repository provides the information regarding collecting HPC values on Intel Xeon processor with different tools such as Perf, 
Intel PCM, PAPI and so on. 
In addition, we provide sample HPC traces of malware and side-channel attacks (will be added in near future).

The HPC traces of malware collected on Intel core using Perf tool. This dataset (and its previous version) is used for malware detection in various works.
